    "description": "The `vsphere_compute_cluster_vm_affinity_rule` resource can be used to manage\nVM affinity rules in a cluster, either created by the\n[`vsphere_compute_cluster`][tf-vsphere-cluster-resource] resource or looked up\nby the [`vsphere_compute_cluster`][tf-vsphere-cluster-data-source] data source.\n\n[tf-vsphere-cluster-resource]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/compute_cluster.html\n[tf-vsphere-cluster-data-source]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/compute_cluster.html\n\nThis rule can be used to tell a set to virtual machines to run together on a\nsingle host within a cluster. When configured, DRS will make a best effort to\nensure that the virtual machines run on the same host, or prevent any operation\nthat would keep that from happening, depending on the value of the\n[`mandatory`](#mandatory) flag.\n\n-> Keep in mind that this rule can only be used to tell VMs to run together on\na _non-specific_ host - it can't be used to pin VMs to a host. For that, see\nthe\n[`vsphere_compute_cluster_vm_host_rule`][tf-vsphere-cluster-vm-host-rule-resource]\nresource.\n\n[tf-vsphere-cluster-vm-host-rule-resource]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/compute_cluster_vm_host_rule.html\n\n~> **NOTE:** This resource requires vCenter and is not available on direct ESXi\nconnections.\n\n~> **NOTE:** vSphere DRS requires a vSphere Enterprise Plus license.",
