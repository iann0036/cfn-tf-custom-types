    "description": "Provides a CEN cross-regional interconnection bandwidth resource. To connect networks in different regions, you must set cross-region interconnection bandwidth after buying a bandwidth package. The total bandwidth set for all the interconnected regions of a bandwidth package cannot exceed the bandwidth of the bandwidth package. By default, 1 Kbps bandwidth is provided for connectivity test. To run normal business, you must buy a bandwidth package and set a proper interconnection bandwidth.\n\nFor example, a CEN instance is bound to a bandwidth package of 20 Mbps and  the interconnection areas are Mainland China and North America. You can set the cross-region interconnection bandwidth between US West 1 and China East 1, China East 2, China South 1, and so on. However, the total bandwidth set for all the interconnected regions cannot exceed 20  Mbps.\n\nFor information about CEN and how to use it, see [Cross-region interconnection bandwidth](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/65983.htm)",
