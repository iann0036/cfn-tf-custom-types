An application rule\nallows to directly manipulate and manage IP application traffic with load balancer.\n\n~> **Note:** To make load balancing work one must ensure that load balancing is enabled on edge\ngateway (edge gateway must be advanced).\nThis depends on NSX version to work properly. Please refer to [VMware Product Interoperability\nMatrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&29=&93=) \nto check supported vCloud director and NSX for vSphere configurations.\n\n~> **Note:** The vCloud Director API for NSX supports a subset of the operations and objects defined\nin the NSX vSphere API Guide. The API supports NSX 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.\n\nSupported in provider *v2.4+*",
