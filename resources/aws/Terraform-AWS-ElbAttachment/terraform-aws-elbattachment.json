For attaching resources with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), see the [`aws_lb_target_group_attachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group_attachment.html).\n\n~> **NOTE on ELB Instances and ELB Attachments:** Terraform currently provides\nboth a standalone ELB Attachment resource (describing an instance attached to\nan ELB), and an [Elastic Load Balancer resource](elb.html) with\n`instances` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line\ninstances in conjunction with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a\nconflict and will overwrite attachments.",
