    "description": "This resource provides the Cross Connect resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.\n\nCreates a new cross-connect. Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect in a\n[CrossConnectGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/CrossConnectGroup) so you can use link aggregation\nwith the connection.\n\nAfter creating the `CrossConnect` object, you need to go the FastConnect location\nand request to have the physical cable installed. For more information, see\n[FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).\n\nFor the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the\ncompartment where you want the cross-connect to reside. If you're\nnot sure which compartment to use, put the cross-connect in the\nsame compartment with your VCN. For more information about\ncompartments and access control, see\n[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).\nFor information about OCIDs, see\n[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).\n\nYou may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect.\nIt does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
