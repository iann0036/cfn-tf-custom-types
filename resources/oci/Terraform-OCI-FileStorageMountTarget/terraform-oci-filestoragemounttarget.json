    "description": "This resource provides the Mount Target resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service.\n\nCreates a new mount target in the specified compartment and\nsubnet. You can associate a file system with a mount\ntarget only when they exist in the same availability domain. Instances\ncan connect to mount targets in another availablity domain, but\nyou might see higher latency than with instances in the same\navailability domain as the mount target.\n\nMount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can\nprovide as the host portion of remote target parameters in\nclient mount commands. These private IP addresses are listed\nin the privateIpIds property of the mount target and are highly available. Mount\ntargets also consume additional IP addresses in their subnet.\nDo not use /30 or smaller subnets for mount target creation because they\ndo not have sufficient available IP addresses.\nAllow at least three IP addresses for each mount target.\n\nFor information about access control and compartments, see\n[Overview of the IAM\nService](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).\n\nFor information about availability domains, see [Regions and\nAvailability Domains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm).\nTo get a list of availability domains, use the\n`ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access\nManagement Service API.\n\nAll Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services resources, including\nmount targets, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an\nOracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When you create a resource,\nyou can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a\nresource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource\ntype, or by viewing the resource in the Console.",
