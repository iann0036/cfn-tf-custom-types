    "description": "This resource provides the Vcn resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.\n\nThe VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.\nFor managing these resources, see [Managing Default VCN Resources](/docs/providers/oci/guides/managing_default_resources.html)\n\nCreates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see\n[VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).\n\nFor the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block. Oracle recommends using one of the\nprivate IP address ranges specified in [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) (10.0.0.0/8,\n172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it\nmust not overlap with your on-premises network. You can't change the size of the VCN after creation.\n\nFor the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the VCN to\nreside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which\ncompartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other\nNetworking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see\n[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about OCIDs, see\n[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).\n\nYou may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to\nbe unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.\n\nYou can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the\nInterent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see\n[DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).\n\nThe VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.\nThe OCID for each is returned in the response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their\ncontents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).\n\nThe VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an internet gateway or set up an IPSec VPN\nor FastConnect. For more information, see\n[Overview of the Networking Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm).",
