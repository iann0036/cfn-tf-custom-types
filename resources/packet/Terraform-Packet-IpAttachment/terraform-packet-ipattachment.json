    "description": "Provides a resource to attach elastic IP subnets to devices.\n\nTo attach an IP subnet from a reserved block to a provisioned device, you must derive a subnet CIDR belonging to\none of your reserved blocks in the same project and facility as the target device.\n\nFor example, you have reserved IPv4 address block 147.229.10.152/30, you can choose to assign either the whole\nblock as one subnet to a device; or 2 subnets with CIDRs 147.229.10.152/31' and 147.229.10.154/31; or 4 subnets\nwith mask prefix length 32. More about the elastic IP subnets is [here](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/network/basic/elastic-ips/).\n\nDevice and reserved block must be in the same facility.",
